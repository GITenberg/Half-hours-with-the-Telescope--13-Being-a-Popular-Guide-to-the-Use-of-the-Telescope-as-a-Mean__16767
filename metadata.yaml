description: "Preface:\r\n\r\nThe object which the Author and Publisher of this little\
  \ work have proposed to themselves, has been the production, at a moderate price,\
  \ of a useful and reliable guide to the amateur telescopist.\r\n\r\nAmong the celestial\
  \ phenomena described or figured in this treatise, by far the larger number may\
  \ be profitably examined with small telescopes, and there are none which are beyond\
  \ the range of a good 3-inch achromatic.\r\n\r\nThe work also treats of the construction\
  \ of telescopes, the nature and use of star-maps, and other subjects connected with\
  \ the requirements of amateur observers."
